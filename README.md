# K-Means from Scratch 🧠

This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of the **K-Means clustering algorithm** in Python. It is a step-by-step educational project designed to understand how K-Means works under the hood — without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points into groups based on similarity. This implementation:

- Uses **NumPy** for vectorized operations.
- Initializes centroids randomly or with a fixed seed.
- Iteratively updates cluster assignments and centroids until convergence.
- Visualizes the final clustering result.
